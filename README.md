Project Title
Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System
1. Project Overview
The Student Course Management and Learning Progress Tracking System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline academic course enrollment and learning management. The system allows students to create accounts, browse available courses, enroll in courses, access course materials, track their learning progress, and receive updates regarding their courses.
The application also provides administrators with tools to manage students, courses, enrollments, and progress reports.
This project is ideal for a Full Stack Web Development course because it covers frontend development, backend APIs, database management, authentication, deployment, and security.
